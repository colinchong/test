What new skills have you learned?
I have learned about the figure element and the new way to add strike throughs with <s>.

What has been easy?
The limited set of tags and elements introduced has made the learning sufficiently simple.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I have been diligent in searching around different tools to get answers when I get stuck.
